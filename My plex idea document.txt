  ok, I have been thinking. How am I goint to compair my files.
I need a database. That has the correct information on commercial movies, tv shows, etc. (for personal use)
So I will grab imdb.com database files to parse from. I will need to grab from other databases later.
I need as much info from my media files (for personal use) as I can get, and make a database from them.
I need to create a list comparison of all the information to comparing with.
Then I need to compair each database to make a match. 

  As plex is able to use media center master information files and such. 
We need to duplicate how Media Center Master leaves files for plex to grab from. 
For example(.xml files, information inbedded in media files. etc.)

  Once we have a match. Sence I use plex media server. I want to use the plex naming convention. For all media content.
Continue to orginise and filter. Write/Replace/Rename to files/folders.

  Once this is done. Then download and populate each piece of media with it's metadata from the imdb.com website(pictures:cover art, poster's, etc) grab all information such as file size, quality of media, container information. to show uniformity. Show end results
convert all media content to standerd file container and respective quality. clean all other information to mach and make uniform content control.

Finally, This is were I need help. I need to grab information that show's ownership. legitamization of content.
licences, recipts, anything that show's personal rights to use the content.

Also. this is were the media companies can help. Making a persons media content ligit. Educate the individual's of the world on how they can go about there use and busness practices.

Finnally, open up to what happens to your media collection after you pass on. what rights do you have.

Make a chart or list's of media content rights and practices.

Someware I would like to create a chart of movie statistics. movies own, what percent of movies do i own compared to what 
is in the database files compaired with online resorce database stutistics you get the idea. Even make a compair self 
with others statistics of owning media library from friends, compair ligitly owned media with person media verses unproven ownership
of media. and on and on...

1. At the moment I want to write as much of the software in python as I can. Mostly becouse its all that I really know at the moment.
    java, basic, html, and other languages are considered. If you teach me. Smiles. I just want to understand the code as much as 
    I can. I do know a bit of jave, html, css, mirc scripting and such.
2. I am thinking kivy will take care of the GUI.
3. Turning python software into an exicutible software for windows operating system, I think will be py2exe.exe
    (looking for advice for better)
4. will be using ffmpeg.exe for media file conversions and handling
5. will need sqlite databasing functionality
6.

think we needed free command line image converter, or can python conver for us?
